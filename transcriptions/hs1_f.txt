The birch canoe slid on the smooth planks
Glue the sheet to the dark blue background
It is easy to tell the depth of a well
These days a chicken leg is a rare dish
Rice is often served and ron bulls the juice of lemons makes fine punch
The box was drawn beside the pump truck
The hogs are fed
Chop corn and garbage for our
The steady work faced us
A large thighs and stockings is hard to sell
