The store walls were lined with colored frocks
The Peace League met to discuss their plans
The rise to fame of a person takes luck
Paper is scarce, So right with much care, The quick fox jumped on the sleeping cat
The nozzle of the fire hose was bright breath
Screw the round kept on as tight as needed
Time brings as many changes
The purple tie was ten years old
Men think and plan and sometimes act
